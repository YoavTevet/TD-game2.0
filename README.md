# TD-game2.0
A sort of new version for my TD game. added a better tank placing mechanism (don't feel like finishing the rest of the project rn).

The game is based on the tower defense game that I have previously made (about 4 months before that one [I think]).
It is not finished by any means, but if you understand the code yourself I'm sure you'll be able to complete the gameplay but just spawning enemies.

I don't feel like finishing it right now because my entire goal was pretty much just to change the tank placement mechanism (which I have achieved).

I am looking for a way to create another type of defense that can actually aim, and not just shoot bullets in a fixed direction, however I'm too lazy which means
that is not likely to happen in the near future (or ever).

Sorry I'm so fucking boring.
